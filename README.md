WebRTC peer to peer calls for everyone. See it live in action at
[peercalls.com][peer-calls].

[peer-calls]: https://peercalls.com

This is a branch for Peer Calls version 3. The new v4 alpha is available on the master branch (formerly called `server-go` branch). The server has been completely rewriten in Go and all the original functionality works. An optional implementation of a Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) is being made to make Peer Calls consume less bandwith for user video uploads. Once implemented, it will be released as `Peer Calls v4`.

# Configuration

There has been a breaking change in `v3.0.0`. The default binary provided via
NPM is now called peer-calls, while it used to be peercalls. This has been made
to make `npx peer-calls` work.

Version 3 also changed the way configuration works. Previously, `config` module
was used to read config files. To make things simpler, a default STUN
configuration will now be used by default. Config files can still be provided
via the `config/` folder in the working directory, but the extension read will
be `.yaml` instead of `.json`.

The config files are read in the following order:

- `node_modules/peer-calls/config/default.yaml`
- `node_modules/peer-calls/config/${NODE_ENV}.yaml`, if `NODE_ENV` is set
- `node_modules/peer-calls/config/local.yaml`
- `./config/default.yaml`
- `./config/${NODE_ENV}.yaml`, if `NODE_ENV` is set
- `./config/local.yaml`

No errors will be thrown if a file is not found, but an error will be thrown
when the required properties are not found. To debug configuration issues,
set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `DEBUG=peercalls,peercalls:config`.

Additionally, version 3 provides easier configuration via environment
variables. For example:

 - Set STUN/TURN servers: `PEERCALLS__ICE_SERVERS='[{"url": "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302", "urls": "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"}]'`
 - Change base URL: `PEERCALLS__BASE_URL=/test` - app will now be accessible at `localhost:3000/test`
 - Enable HTTPS: `PEERCALLS__SSL='{"cert": "/path/to/cert.pem", "key": "/path/to/cert.key"}'`
 - Disable HTTPS: `PEERCALLS__SSL=undefined`
 - Listen on a different port: `PORT=3001` (default is `3000`)
 - Bind to specific IP or hostname: `BIND=127.0.0.1`

See [config/default.yaml][config] for sample configuration.

[config]: ./config/default.yaml

By default, the server will start on port `3000`. This can be modified by
setting the `PORT` environment variable to another number, or to a path for a
unix domain socket.

To access the server, go to http://localhost:3000 (or another port).

# Multiple Instances and Redis

Redis can be used to allow users connected to different instances to connect.
The following needs to be added to `config.yaml` to enable Redis:

```yaml
store:
  type: redis
  host: 127.0.0.1   # redis host
  port: 6379        # redis port
  prefix: peercalls # all instances must use the same prefix
```

# Logging

By default, Peer Calls server will log only basic information. Client-side
logging is disabled by default.

Server-side logs can be configured via the `DEBUG` environment variable. Setting
it to `peercalls,peercalls:*` will enable all server-side logging:

- `DEBUG=peercalls,peercalls:* npm run start:server`

Client-side logs can be configured via `localStorage.debug` and
`localStorage.log` variables:

- Setting `localStorage.log=1` enables logging of Redux actions and state
  changes
- Setting `localStorage.debug=peercalls,peercalls:*` enables all other
  client-side logging. You might want to include `simple-peer` here as well.

# Development

Below are some common NPM scripts that are used for development:

```
npm start              start the precompiled server.
npm run build          build all client-side resources.
npm run start:server   start and compile server-side TypeScript on the fly,
                       restarts the server when the resources change.
npm run start:watch    start the server, and recompile client-side resources
                       when the sources change.
npm test               run all tests.
npm run ci             run all linting, tests and build the client-side
```

# Browser Support

Tested on Firefox and Chrome, including mobile versions. Also works on Safari,
however connection issues have been reported.

Does not work on iOS 10, but should work on iOS 11 - would appreciate feedback!

For more details, see here:

- http://caniuse.com/#feat=rtcpeerconnection
- http://caniuse.com/#search=getUserMedia

In Firefox, it might be useful to use `about:webrtc` to debug connection
issues. In Chrome use `about:webrtc-internals`.

When experiencing connection issues, the first thing to try is to have all
peers to use the same browser.

# TURN Server

When a direct connection cannot be established, it might be help to use a TURN
server. The peercalls.com instance is configured to use a TURN server and it
can be used for testing. However, the server bandwidth there is not unlimited.

Here are the steps to install a TURN server on Ubuntu/Debian Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install coturn
```

Use the following configuration as a template for `/etc/turnserver.conf`:

```bash
lt-cred-mech
use-auth-secret
static-auth-secret=PASSWORD
realm=example.com
total-quota=300
cert=/etc/letsencrypt/live/rtc.example.com/fullchain.pem
pkey=/etc/letsencrypt/live/rtc.example.com/privkey.pem
log-file=/dev/stdout
no-multicast-peers
proc-user=turnserver
proc-group=turnserver
```

Change the `PASSWORD`, `realm`  and paths to server certificates.

Use the following configuration for Peer Calls:

```yaml
iceServers:
- url: 'turn:rtc.example.com'
  urls: 'turn:rtc.example.com'
  username: 'example'
  secret: 'PASSWORD'
  auth: 'secret'
```

Finally, enable and start the `coturn` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable coturn
sudo systemctl start coturn
```

# TODO

- [x] Do not require config files and allow configuration via environment
  variables. (Fixed in 23fabb0)
- [x] Show menu dialog before connecting (Fixed in 0b4aa45)
- [x] Reduce production build size by removing Pug. (Fixed in 2d14e5f c743f19)
- [x] Add ability to share files (Fixed in 3877893)
- [ ] Enable node cluster support (to scale vertically).
- [x] Add Socket.IO support for Redis (to scale horizontally).
- [ ] Add support for browser push notifications
- [ ] Allow other methods of connectivity, beside mesh. Experimental work done in `server-go` branch.
